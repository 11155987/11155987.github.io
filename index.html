	<p>Wearable technology started with the watch enabling individuals to tell the time, initially in the 1500’s via a necklace worn device, and later in the 1900’s as the wristwatch. Pulsar’s calculator wristwatch was the first consumable wearable device to achieve global success. Fast forward to the 21st Century and we now see computer technology integrated into so many parts of daily life. In the year 2000, the first Bluetooth headset was sold and 2004 saw the launch of the Go Pro. 2013 heralded the development of Google Glass, the first voice operated optical head mounted display with hands free internet access with Augmented Reality and the ability to capture images. Amazon’s first Echo-Loop was launched in 2019, a sleek design enabling users to make payments, manage stress and inspire innovation. Connected wearable devices are expected to have reached over 1.1 billion worldwide by 2022 with the change from 4 to 5G. Pioneers have successfully extended and enriched the functionality of clothing, harnessing the electronic functions used in everyday life and incorporating them into devices and accessories that can comfortably be worn on the body.</p>
